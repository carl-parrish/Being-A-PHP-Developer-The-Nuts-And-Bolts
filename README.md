Being A PHP Developer: The Nuts and Bolts
=========================================

Being a developer is part Art, part Science, and part getting your hands dirty.  This guide focuses on the tools that support all these phases, but mostly the getting your hands dirty part.

In any project tools and infrastructure can be a double edge sword.  You can't build a table without a hammer and a saw, but at the same time it might be overkill to build an entire workshop before building a bird house.  In this guide we try to get the tools out of the way quickly, giving you best practices to get to the task in hand.  Once you are off and running with a couple projects you will likely find tools and infrastructure you want to dig deeper into.  My advice to is wait until those needs come, and just start with the basics.
