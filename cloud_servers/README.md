# Cloud Servers

"The Cloud" such a trendy term these days, but don't let the trendiness fool you, there is a lot of power in the cloud.  You get an API to manage your servers and in some cases associated services.  You get to pay by the hour with no long term contracts (in most cases).  You get great pricing on a basic server from providers like Digital Ocean.

Even if the cloud isn't the right fit for every project, its easy to see how a $10 a month server with API control can be the right fit for testing and staging environments.  It might even make sense to use it for development rather then buying more hardware for all the VM's you find yourself running.

Lets set one up at Digital Ocean so our next tutorial on deployment has a destination.
