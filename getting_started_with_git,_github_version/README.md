# Getting started with Git, Github Version

Github makes it easy to get started with Git.  The easiest thing to do is install the Gui client, it includes all the needed dependencies (which can be a hassle on windows) and gets you up and running in minutes.

## Create an account
First [create an account](https://github.com/), while following this tutorial you will be creating a public project so a free account works.  If you want to create private projects costs start at $7 a month. I find thats a reasonable price to pay for redudant infrasructure and backups, if thats more then you are willing to pay, [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/plans) offers private repos for free.

## Install the Client
* Windows: https://windows.github.com/
* Mac: https://mac.github.com/

## Create a repository
You can follow along in two ways with this tutorial.  You can create a new empty repo, or you can fork the example repository.  The example repository includes some PHP code that is used in later tutorials.
