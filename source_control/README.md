# Source Control

One of the most important tools in a developers toolbok is a source control management tool.  The important thing is that you are using a tool, and using it well, which tool is less imporant.  There are tons of choices including:
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Subversions](http://subversion.apache.org/)
* [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/)
* [Cvs](http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/)

If you are new to a tool, I recommend using Git in a hosted environment like [Github](http://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).  In the PHP world most open source libraries and projects use Git and are hosted on Github, so its a tool you will likely be seeing in your future if you haven't seen it already.  Our first tutorial covers the basics of using Git, but if you have never used Git before (or another distributed version control system), you might want to check out the [Atlassian Git Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/) or the [Guidehub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)

No matter which tool you pick, using a big name hosted source control platform gets you started without a lot of effort.  Having proper backups, permission management and a nice interface means you are spending less time on tools and more time getting things done.

Github and Bitbucket also offer additional features like bug tracking, code review, and documentation wikis.  You likely won't need these features at the begining of a project but you never know where a project might lead, and they can be very helpful down the road.
