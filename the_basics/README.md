# The Basics

There are lots of tools you need to develop sites in PHP.  This guide focuses on the ones I see new developers struggle with on a regular basis.  This includes:
* Source Control
* Development Environment
* Managing PHP Dependencies
* Deployment

There are plenty of other tools you will need, some more basic like an editor, and some more advanced like a Unit testing library; in order to keep this guide focused we will leave those questions to others to answer.
